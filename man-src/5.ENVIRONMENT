[[GPG_FOLDER]]
By default, {program} will look for the gpg database in ~/.gnupg. You can override this with the GPG_FOLDER environment variable. Example:{br}
    GPG_FOLDER=/var/test/mygpg {program} ...
Setting the variable just before invoking {program} will point the GPG_FOLDER elsewhere.
[[GPG_STASHED_FOLDER]]
By default, {program} will stash the database in ~/.gnupg.stashed. You can override this with the GPG_STASHED_FOLDER environment variable. Example:{br}
    GPG_STASHED_FOLDER=/var/test/mygpgstash {program} ...
